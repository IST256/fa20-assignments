If things did not go well, we are here to help, but you must articulate the specifics of your problem. \"I can't figure out how to call the API\" or \"I don't know how to use the module\" are inadequate queries and demonstate a need for more effort on your part.\n",

If your code doesn't work, we expect you to have questions and we expect those questions to be as specific as possible. Sometimes the mere process of trying to explain your specific problem helps you to arive at the solution or at least other ways to attack the problem."
