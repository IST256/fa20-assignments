    "- The programming style and idioms will match those you were taught in class. We should not see code outside of the style learned in IST256.\n",
    "- Does the code clearly demonstrate what you have learned in the course and that you are capable of acquiring new programming skills and techniques independently ?\n",
    "- Does your journal adequately reflect upon the work youâ€™ve done?\n",
    "- Will your code execute for the evaluator? Does it have everything they need in this notebook? HINT: Go to the control panel, click **Stop My Server**, then start your notebook back up and run your P3 code again to make sure it works in a clean notebook.\n",
